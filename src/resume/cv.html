    <h4 class="text-center keyline-bottom">Strength & Experience</h4>
    <p>
      Maintain several websites and software libraries, including a Rails
      application tracking approximately 500 volunteer hours per month and a
      Jekyll plugin with ~450 stars on GitHub.
    </p>
    <p>
      As an aircrew member: think and act under pressure, integrate with a team,
      handle complex system failures, know & apply best practices, apply complex
      procedures, self-supervise, and self-instruct.

          This Rails application provides training, bulletin, document library,
          and time tracking features to a volunteer component of a county
          sheriff's office. It has been reliably tracking ~500 volunteer hours
          per month since January 2018. I am the only maintainer.

          This is a popular Jekyll Plugin which automates the tedious process of
          implementing responsive images.
        </p>
        <p>
          I didn't write it originally, but I did rewrite it! I expanded its
          feature set in line with modern standards, and greatly improved the
          plugin's architecture to simplify future improvements. My rewrite went
          live in November of 2018, and the original maintainer handed the
          project over to me in June of 2019.

          I wrote this data-wrangling web-application in mid-2019 to solve a
          daily, tedious problem for a group of battery researchers. It runs
          entirely in client-side javascript, taking in thousands of lines of
          raw data in an inconvenient format and returning it in one or more
          organized, useful formats.

          customized a pre-made theme.

          This is a project which aims to archive the coronavirus statistics
          which US states are legally required to report, by crawling their
          websites directly. I contributed several pull requests, including
          significant refactoring of its overall architecture, improvement of
          its Command Line Interface, and several individual state crawlers.

          This is a featherweight, dependency-less ruby gem which generates
          HTML. As I was working with Jekyll Icon List and Jekyll Picture Tag, I
          realized that string interpolation and concatenation are entirely
          inadequate for programmatically building HTML, and wrote a few classes
          to handle the task more easily without requiring Nokogiri.

          This is a small Jekyll plugin, written in Ruby, which builds lists of
          icons & labels (like the one above this paragraph!) It saves a lot of
          time writing and updating markup.
