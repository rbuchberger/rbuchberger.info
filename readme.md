# Personal website/portfolio/blog

This is a small, static website meant to show my projects and blog.
It's built with jekyll, from scratch (taking some inspiration from the
[sustain](https://github.com/jekyller/sustain) theme.)

## Usage

* Start a development server: `$ npm run dev`
* Build for production: `$ npm run build`
* Build for production & start a server: `$ npm run serve`
