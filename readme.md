# Personal website/portfolio/blog

This is a small, static website meant to show my projects, my resume, and blog. It's built with jekyll, from scratch (taking some inspiration from the [sustain](https://github.com/jekyller/sustain) theme.) I'm hosting it in an Amazon S3 bucket, distributing it through cloudfront, and pushing it with the [s3_website](https://github.com/laurilehmijoki/s3_website) gem.

I may impersonate a real designer and build a jekyll theme out of it, wouldn't take a drastic amount of work. Depends how long it takes me to get hired, I guess.
