# Personal website/portfolio/blog

This is a small, static website meant to show my projects, my resume, and blog. It's built with jekyll, from scratch (taking some inspiration from the [sustain](https://github.com/jekyller/sustain) theme.) I'm hosting it in an Amazon S3 bucket, distributing it through cloudfront, and pushing it with the [s3_website](https://github.com/laurilehmijoki/s3_website) gem. 

I built it to be fast, simple, accessible, and modern. I don't care about supporting old browsers. I make extensive use of Flexbox, HTML semantic elements, and CSS grid. Many themes I've seen include thousands of lines of CSS and have nested divs piled up on top of each other; they work, but I don't believe it's required to show a few pages of content. 

The icon + list item generator I use for the resume and project pages would make a decent plugin/ruby gem; right now I'm doing goofy things with jekyll tags to make it work. Seeing as this project is mostly HTML and CSS, and I would like to be more than an HTML + CSS developer, it wouldn't be a bad idea to show off some actual code as well. 

I may impersonate a real designer and build a jekyll theme out of it, wouldn't take a drastic amount of work. Depends how long it takes me to get hired, I guess.
