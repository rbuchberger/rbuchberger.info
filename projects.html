        A year ago I didn't know anything about web development; everything below has been accomplished since then. During that time I also held another job, deployed to the Middle East, and moved from the US to Poland. I certainly have more to learn, but there's very little I can't teach myself.

                This Rails application provides training, bulletin, document library, and volunteer time tracking features to a small component of a county sheriff's office. It followed in the footsteps of the upskill tutorial, using many of the same frameworks and services.

                This is a recruitment, blog, and project site for a university research grant. I used a static site generator, customized a pre-made theme (<a href="https://github.com/iwiedenm/jekyll-theme-massively-src">Massively</a>), and dropped it in an S3 bucket.

                Started with an introduction to the fundamentals and a simple blog, then moved on to building a complete website. I'd toyed around with some programming and basic web pages before, but this was my practical introduction to Ruby on Rails, relational databases, REST, version control, and a high level understanding of the architecture behind a functioning web application.
