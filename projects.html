<h1>Projects</h1>
<p>I'm pretty new to the game; I started taking some online courses in September 2017. My first real project was Rob Dey's <a href="#">Upskill</a> tutorial, and I've been improving my skills since then!</p>

    <dd>Wes Bos is a cool guy. Work in progress; this one got interrupted by a deployment.</dd>

    <dt>Upskill SAAS app</dt>

    <dd>Very short project, but worth including.</dd>
